                <AboutCard>
                    <p>At the begining of my softmore year in highschool my fascination with Computer Science began. It started with simple gaming projects and introduction to fundamentals. This initial spark led me to explore the depths of coding. Today, I thrive as a student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute WPI, where I blend innovative coding techniques with high-level problem-solving skills to complete projects.</p>
                    <p>My current passion revolves around leveraging problem-solving and high-level thinking for system design for complex software applications. The thrill for me lies in crafting systems that are not only functionally excellent but also architecturally sound, ensuring that they perform seamlessly under various scenarios.</p>
                    <p>When I'm away from my keyboard, you'll find me indulging in my love for physical fitness, whether it's pushing limits at the gym, catching waves while surfing, or simply hanging out with friends. Each session is a chance to disconnect and draw energy from dynamic physical activities, which I bring back to my coding projects with renewed vigor and a fresh perspective.</p>
